NumberWorder
============

Create a console application (numberworder.exe) that expects a single numeric parameter. The application prints each character in the number as a word. 

E.g.

> numberworder.exe 1234
> 
> ONETWOTHREEFOUR

Additional considerations
-------------------------

* what happens if the user does executes the program incorrectly? How can you provide feedback that shows them the correct way?
* what happens if the input is invalid (e.g. alpha characters)?
